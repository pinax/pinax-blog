# pinax-blog

Originally named `biblion`, the eldarion.com blog app intended to be suitable
for site-level company and project blogs, is now known as `pinax-blog`.

!!! note "Pinax Ecosystem"
    This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app
    and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.
