Biblion was the eldarion.com blog which we've extracted and open sourced.


Current features include:

 * support for multiple channels (e.g. technical vs business)
 * use of Creole and Markdown as markup format
 * Atom and RSS feeds
 * previewing of blog posts before publishing
 * optional ability to announce new posts on twitter
 * Traditional date based urls or simpler slug-only urls, via configuration
 * Control over opengraph and twitter card meta data per post
 * Review comments per post for multi-author workflows
