This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app
and can be used independently of other Pinax apps. To learn more about Pinax,

This app used to be named `biblion` when originally developed by Eldarion, Inc.
Upon donating the Pinax, the app was renamed to `pinax-blog`, making it easier
to find and know what it is.
